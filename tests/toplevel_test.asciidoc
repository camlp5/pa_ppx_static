`pa_ppx_static`: what it says on the tin
========================================
:toc:
:toc-placement: preamble

This package provides two PPX extensions:

`[%static ...]`::

This can be used anywhere an expression can be used.  The payload must
be an expression, and that expression will be moved to the top of the
file (or compilation unit) where it will be assigned a fresh name;
that name will be used in place of the expression, so that the
expression will be evaluated only once.  Viz.
```
let f s =
  let re = [%static Pcre.regexp "(a)(b)(c))"] in
  Pcre.exec ~rex s
```

`[%%static_preamble ...]`::

This can *only* be used at the first code in a *file* (not in the
toplevel) (e.g. at top of file, but possibly after comments) and
provides statements that will precede all the expressions in static
blocks.  That is to say (again, only in files), the preamble

```
[%%static_preamble open Pcre]
```
could then allow the example above to become
```
let f s =
  let re = [%static regexp "(a)(b)(c))"] in
  Pcre.exec ~rex s
```

NOTE that the `Pcre.exec` hasn't changed: we didn't `open Pcre` for
the entire file, only for the static blocks.

== Installation and Invocation

To install this package via opam:
```
opam install pa_ppx_static
```

to build and install, once `pa_ppx` is installed, `make all test` will do the rest.

=== Usage vla the OCaml compiler

To use this PPX rewriter via the OCaml batch compiler, put your static declarations 

=== In the OCaml toplevel

```ocaml
# #use "topfind.camlp5";;
- : unit = ()
Findlib has been successfully loaded. Additional directives:
  #require "package";;      to load a package
  #list;;                   to list the available packages
  #camlp4o;;                to load camlp4 (standard syntax)
  #camlp4r;;                to load camlp4 (revised syntax)
  #predicates "p,q,...";;   to set these predicates
  Topfind.reset();;         to force that packages will be reloaded
  #thread;;                 to enable threads

- : unit = ()
Additional Camlp5 directives:
  #camlp5o;;                to load camlp5 (standard syntax)
  #camlp5r;;                to load camlp5 (revised syntax)

# #require "pa_ppx_static" ;;
```

== Examples

```ocaml
# let x = [%static 2] ;;
val __static_0__ : int Pa_ppx_static_runtime.Static.t = <abstr>
val x : int = 2
```

```ocaml
# [%static 1] ;;
- : int = 1
```

```ocaml
# #use "use_test_ml";;
val __static_0__ : int Pa_ppx_static_runtime.Static.t = <abstr>
val hd : 'a -> int = <fun>
- : int = 2
val x : int = 1
```
